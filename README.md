> Kids in October struggle to make four pull requests. We superior beings must get our free tyrannosaurus-shirts by hacking NASA. Get onboard the quest by making a pull request to this repo. **Everyone is welcome**. Everyone means you too Elon Musk!

## How to get on-board

1. Edit the `src/contributors.js` file and add your details in the given format.

    ```js
    export const <your-github-id> = {
        name: <your-name>,
        username: <your-github-id>
    };
    ```

2. Now make a pull request.
3. There is no step 3.
